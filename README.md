# haunted-pulse
DXARTS 490 Final Project


Inspired by Professor Phillip Thurtle's article on "Goth Biology", Haunted Pulse aims to visualize and physically manifest the continuous feedback loop between life and death. Comprised of two contrasting sleeves representing life and decay, the garment senses the wearers heartbeat through a pulse sensor which is connected to a servo motor via Arduino Lilypad to prompt movement of feathers. The aesthetic of the piece was chosen to evoke how all the changes from the cycles of life and death that occur within our bodies stay within us and in a way, haunt us.
